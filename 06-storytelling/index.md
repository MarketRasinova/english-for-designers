# Storytelling

#### Why do you love what you do?

​	I really enjoy the **freedom of creating**. Especially when it comes to package design. Every time I come across a blank mockup, I get hyped to start creating. It's like buying a new sketchbook and being super excited to start drawing in it. 

​	Being able to work with many different brands and helping them stand out is also my favorite part. Working with exciting color pallets, fonts, patterns and illustrations that **help these brands become so memorable** is honestly so rewarding. I love it.

​	The thought of **seeing my package designs displayed on shelves**. My designs being heavily associated with the products. Them being in other peoples homes, people looking at them and remembering them. I honestly cannot imagine a better achievement for myself. It doesn't compare to anything else.

#### What do you believe in? What’s your design philosophy?

*"Ideas come from everything."*

​	Being open to ideas from unexpected places leads to really fun ideas and creative projects. Just noticing small things that make you *YOU* is exciting and builds a more authentic image about your brand or you as a designer.


#### Who inspired/inspires you?


**Abi Connick**

- A huge role model that inspired me and taught me to believe in myself


**Brandon Shepherd**

- An amazing designer and a huge inspiration. 
- He taught me a lot of tips and tricks through his design process videos. (So entertaining!!!)

#### Where does your inspiration come from?

- interacting with everyday objects and being inspired to redesign their packages/brand
- seeing other creators on Instagram, Pinterest, in package design books, etc.
#### When was that aha moment?

​	Being stuck for a long time, I always found myself wondering what is it I'm doing wrong. I couldn't find anything I did that resonated with me and so I didn't really like anything I created. I knew I loved designing and creating. I had no doubt graphic design was the right path for me. But graphic design being such a vague term, I knew I just haven't found the right thing.

​	So one day when I was taking a bath, I started thinking about it once again. Feeling really lost and overwhelmed... Without thinking I grabbed a random soap bottle and started analyzing the package. That's usually what I do when I get bored in the bathtub and don't want to get out just yet. And then it hit me. I would love to design packages, such as these soap bottles. I realized, how excited I get when I spot a product I love just by looking at the package design. The thought of seeing my designs displayed for everyone to see on shelves - it just blew my mind!

​	And so I started looking more into package design, found a bunch of amazing creators that inspired me to do little passion projects to help brands I would love to work with to recognize me and be more inclined to work with me. Up until then, it didn't occur to me that designing doesn't have to be for clients or for school projects. I could just... download a mockup and go crazy and have fun doing what I enjoy. This opened up a whole new world to me and I couldn't be happier.
