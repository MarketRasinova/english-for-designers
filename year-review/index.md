**1. What did you like most about this subject?**

​		How we could focus on our passions and on who we are as a person. Thanks to these lessons, I became more confident not only in my abilities, but 		in myself as an individual. It helped me build a portfolio, write a CV and create many great case studies of my work. 

**2. What did you like least about this subject?**

​		Honestly? Nothing. These English lessons were nothing like those I experienced before and I would not change a thing. 

**3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year?**

​		Who I am and where my power lies.

​		Who I want to be and how to work on myself.

​		To not be afraid to try everything. To not care if people see my mistakes and watch me grow.

**4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?**

​		Probably the thesis presentation. It pushed me to be try talking to the camera with the knowledge that the whole world can see my video and hear 		me talk. I used to be and still am ashamed of talking in English in front of some people. Even mortified that they'll shame me for making mistakes. 		And this was a huge leap out of my comfort zone. 

**5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?**

​		I feel like I gained more confidence than ever before during my life. I feel like your way of interacting with your students brings so much comfort. 		That classroom truly feels like a safe space to grow. And with that feeling like I'm allowed to do those mistakes, I became more confident in my work 		and myself.

**6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?**

​		That I can achieve almost anything I want, if I try hard enough and change my perspective. That I can overcome my fears and grow over time. 

**7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?**

​		Nothing. I enjoyed it a lot!

**8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?**

​		I bet I could have done better in many things. But mainly, I wish I spent more time on our assignments then I did. I get easily overwhelmed by a task 		& procrastinate until I have a few hours before I have to go to bed. Most of the time, I finished these assignments late at night, the day before the 		presentation. I wish I spent a day writing, got some sleep and came back the next day to it to see the mistakes I made. 

**9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?**

​		Nothing. You are one of the sweetest, caring and supportive I've ever had. Your compliments on my work always brighten my day and mean so 		much to me. You truly helped me in many ways and I bet I'm not the only one. Thank you for being there for us! 

**10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?**

​		Be open to make mistakes. Because without them, you won't grow.
