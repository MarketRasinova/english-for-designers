# Voice & Tone

Voice and tone are one of the most important aspect of presenting your work. I believe it reflects your attitude about given subject and it is important to keep your listeners/readers interested. Because if you don't, it reflects on you not being interested in the subject to begin with. It is so important, that's why it's so difficult. 

## Voice

When presenting, I try to stay as calm as possible, speak loudly and clearly and I'm not afraid to show my personality. I feel like when listening to a presentation, I am more interested when the presenter feels genuine. They laugh, smile, joke around, but are obviously well educated about the subject and keep the presentation interesting.

## Tone

As expected, I change tone when talking to different audiences. When surrounded with same-minded individuals, such as my classmates, I am more comfortable and allow myself to openly make mistakes and learn from them. When talking to a client, I cannot show any weakness, such as nervousness and awkwardness. I try to be confident, seem as a professional that is well educated and is confident in having the best solution for the client, yet still be myself.
