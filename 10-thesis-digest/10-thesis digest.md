## Abstract

This paper focuses on a new efficient package design of ZON lemonades. It aims to attract consumers' attention and correspond to ZON's brand. Its main focus is to increase the attractiveness of the product. According to a study from 2011, it was found that 44,6 % of interviewed people found the packaging to be outdated. When compared to data from 2022, the unhappiness with the brand's design grew to 73 %. The design process is based on the information gained from both studies and a modern form of effectiveness testing. Its focus is to rebrand the ZON lemonades with an effective design strategy. It aims to highlight the brand's personality and make its products appealing.

## Main Text
This thesis is separated into two sections – theoretical and practical. The first section is focused on the process of designing a package. It dives into the psychology of packaging and how the human brain works. It talks about what aspects of packaging design are the most important to highlight and how to create an effective hierarchy of elements. Afterwards, it focuses on design strategy, shopability and effectiveness of the package. In the end, it gives an insight into a brand identity and its target audience. The second section introduces ZON, its logo, visual identity and packages. It analyzes the visuals and suggests a strategy to modernize the brand to better communicate its personality. Afterwards, it focuses on the findings of its survey and compares them to the findings of a similar survey from 2011.

It takes the knowledge and designs a package with a personalized design strategy, a logo and marketing communication.

### The package design:
During the creation of the new label for ZON lemonades, I wanted to highlight the most important element – the flavour itself. I wanted the fruit to be the star of the whole package and to be recognized even from further away. The brand is known for its long tradition and the nostalgia people feel. I wanted this lemonade to look prestigious and classy. And so I thought of the idea of the fruit being cut out to further highlight the colour of the lemonade itself.
Since the original packaging was so busy, I wanted to only keep the most important information and space it out better. So I made the decision of making the label longer and hiding the rest on the sides. This sort of information is not the key that helps people make the decision to buy the product. Thus it is better to hide it to make the centre of the label as spacious and clean as possible.
