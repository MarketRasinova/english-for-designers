# Digest: Package design of ZON lemonades

## Abstract

This paper focuses on a new efficient package design of ZON lemonades. It aims to attract consumers' attention, correspond to ZON's brand values and increase the overall attractiveness of the product. According to a study from 2011, it was found that 44,6 % of interviewed people found the packaging to be outdated. When compared to data from 2022, the unhappiness with the brand's design grew to 73 %. Based on the information gained from both studies and a modern form of effectiveness testing, the focus of this thesis is to rebrand the ZON lemonades with an effective design strategy to highlight the brand's personality and make its products appealing.
